A prominent example is the [`crate::IbcMsg::Transfer`] message. Without callbacks, you cannot know that someone sent you IBC coins.\n\nIt is important to validate that the packet and acknowledgement are what you expect them to be. For example for a transfer message, the receiver is not necessarily the contract itself.\n\nThe callback is called when the packet is being acknowledged on the destination chain. This happens for both synchronous and asynchronous acknowledgements.\n\nNote that there are some prerequisites that need to be fulfilled to receive destination callbacks: - The contract must implement the `ibc_destination_callback` entrypoint. - The IBC application in the destination chain must have support for the callbacks middleware. - You have to add serialized [`IbcCallbackRequest`] to a specific field of the message.

  "description": "This is the final result type that is created and serialized in a contract for every init/execute/migrate call. The VM then deserializes this type to distinguish between successful and failed executions.\n\nWe use a custom type here instead of Rust's Result because we want to be able to define the serialization, which is a public interface. Every language that compiles to Wasm and runs in the ComsWasm VM needs to create the same JSON representation.\n\n# Examples\n\nSuccess:\n\n``` # use cosmwasm_std::{to_vec, ContractResult, Response}; let response: Response = Response::default(); let result: ContractResult<Response> = ContractResult::Ok(response); assert_eq!(to_vec(&result).unwrap(), br#\"{\"ok\":{\"messages\":[],\"attributes\":[],\"events\":[],\"data\":null}}\"#.to_vec()); ```\n\nFailure:\n\n``` # use cosmwasm_std::{to_vec, ContractResult, Response}; let error_msg = String::from(\"Something went wrong\"); let result: ContractResult<Response> = ContractResult::Err(error_msg); assert_eq!(to_vec(&result).unwrap(), br#\"{\"error\":\"Something went wrong\"}\"#.to_vec()); ```",

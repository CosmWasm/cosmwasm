**Web Assembly Smart Contracts for the Cosmos SDK**

This repo provides a useful functionality to build smart contracts that
are compatible with Cosmos SDK runtime, [currently being developed](https://github.com/cosmwasm/cosmos-sdk/issues).

## Creating a Smart Contract

You can see some examples of contracts under the `contracts` directory.
We aim to provide more tooling to help this process, but for now it is a manual step.
You can do this in the `contracts` directory if you are working in this project, or
wherever you want in your own project. 

You can follow more instructions on how to [configure a library for wasm](./Building.md)

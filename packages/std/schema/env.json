Additional signers of the transaction that are either needed for other messages or contain unnecessary signatures are not propagated into the contract.\n\nThere is a disussion to open up this field to multiple initiators, which you're welcome to join if you have a specific need for that feature: https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/issues/293",
